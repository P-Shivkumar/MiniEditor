# MiniEditor
I have created an editor like vim using ncurses library. It is able to insert the text on command (ESC + i). It can also read the text from any file and show it on to the window. I have written the code for save text (after inserting more text) into file but currently it's not working. 
       I will write code for
    1) inserting at the cursor without disturbing other text
    2) delete word 
    3) delete line 
    4) copy word/line and paste at cursor position
